What is Magecart and are Worldline e-payment solutions protected ?  
Come to our presentation to see Magecart Virus in action and how we can defend against it !  

## 📚 Detailed description of the presentation:

If you are a consumer of e-commerce sites you may have heard about a shadowy entity called ‘Magecart’ that has gone from relative obscurity to ascending to the top of the e-commerce industry's public enemy list.  
Magecart breached global brand such as British Airways, Sotheby’s, Cancer Research UK, Ticketmaster and Newegg by placing scripts on these compromised e-commerce sites.  
Magecart is an umbrella term given to at least a dozen cybercriminal groups that are placing digital credit card skimmers on compromised e-commerce sites at an unprecedented rate and with frightening success.  
Only now is Magecart becoming a household name. However, its activity isn't new and points to a complex and thriving criminal underworld that has been operating in the shadows for years.  
The threat from Magecart is now so great that the FBI has issued in October 2019, a warning to the US private sector regarding the attacks.
This cybercrime syndicate specializes in cyberattacks involving credit card theft by skimming online payment forms. It, is fundamentally changing the way we view browser security. 
In this presentation, we will cover the evolution of the groups from 2014 to the present day, detailing the current tactics and techniques used to compromise website JavaScripts.  
As it can be difficult to detect its malicious script residing on the client-facing side of the website, we will demonstrate how it uses breaches in websites and also how we can identify it.
We will also go into the details of how our e-payment solutions are protected against Magecart.
